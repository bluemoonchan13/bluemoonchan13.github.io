    <h3>Animations Galore!!!</h3>
    <a href="http://5years.sutunam.com/"><img src="../images/fiveyrs.png" alt="5 Years with Sutunam" class="left"/></a>
    <p>I visited the 5 years with the Sutunam! <a href="http://5years.sutunam.com/">(http://5years.sutunam.com/)</a> site.
      I came across this site that I thought was very beautiful in it’s imagery and
       this fun idea of using geometric images for all of it’s visuals.
      However I ran into some things that did not sit well with me.</p>
      <p>As you go onto this site, the page loads a lion’s head from these geometric figures coming together from the sides of the screen.
        The colors are well balanced and very well thought out as it is not harsh on the eyes and still captures your attention.
        Then instructions popped up onto the screen telling me to scroll down.
        As I did the title changed from 5 YEARS with Sutunam to 5 PROJECTS.</p>
        <p>Now I was thinking, this is really cool and very stylized modern.
          I wanted to see the original title again and so naturally I scrolled up.
          However as I did, the page would not allow me to go to the original title but instead kept me on the
           current title sequence until I continued to scroll down,
          which led me to the content area.
          From there the geometric figures dispersed, the background changed,
          and the geometric figures appeared again but in the shape of a watch.</p>
    <p>All of this is very visually appealing and the colors are still gorgeous,
       but now I am scrolling furiously to try to get to the title page,
        only to go around this slow merry-go-round of a site around these five sites.
        The site goes from one page to the next in a slow drawn out animated sequence of geometric figures exploding
        and reassembling back together.</p>
    <p>I finally got over the fact that I could not get back to the title sequence and began to actually look at the content.
    It shows a link with a corresponding image about the website it is linked to.
    I was not particularly aware of how these specific sites related until I went into the About page.
     I found a sentence that said “Driven by our desire to provide a good quality service regarding digital branding,
     we present to you our great success from 2015 based on high performing websites and client’s satisfaction.”
     Now that I understood what the site was about, I clicked on the “go to projects” arrow to find myself back at the title
      sequence with the geometric lions head centered on my screen.
       I think the next words that came out of my head was, “Why???” After going to the “about” page,
       I had to go through the drawled sequence again to finally get back to the contents page. Did I mention it was pretty slow.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I got back to the main content and was able to see all of the sites that were linked, I saw a pattern on their sites.
        Two of the sites resemble amazon, one of them is google play, and another one looks like a presidential campaign for hats.
      I actually liked one of them though. It was a site about perfumes.
     It was easy to navigate, I could see where I was going, the colors were soothing, I actually knew what I was looking at,
     and the site resembled a spa where I was able to relax and breath a little. (Deep breath in)</p>
     <p>Ok I have this anger issue that I’ve been trying to work on and I might have taken it out on this site.
        Maybe I am being too harsh on them, so let’s focus on the positives. 5 years Sutunam is visually beautiful.
        If I could have a large screen on my wall, I would have the images on the site on repeat displayed for all to see.
        The colors are brilliant and bold without it being too overpowering.
         The animations are flawless and it is a smooth transition all the way through.
          The hierarchy of the site is obvious and is simple to navigate through.
          There is no fluff and everything is very straightforward, once you get there.</p>
          <p>I love this site for the visual aspects but everything afterwards, well, you read about it.
            Thanks for reading and stay tuned for my next tantrum.
