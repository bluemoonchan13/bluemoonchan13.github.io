    <h3>Meaningful CSS: Style Like You Mean It</h3>
    <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/meaningful-css-style-like-you-mean-it"><img src="../images/meaningfulcss.jpg" alt="n=meaningfulcss" class="left"/></a>
    <p>Coding for me is still hard to comprehend.
       It is hard to figure out which tag is good for whatever I’m coding because there seem to be an infinite
        amount of tags and attributes and elements.
        So when I learned what classes were I thought it tied everything into a neatly tied up box.
         However, after reading the article, “Meaningful CSS: Style Like You Mean It”, I realize that using classes and
          div’s are just an easy way out that can create messes along the way.</p>
	<p>Using HTML in the correct way could be more efficient to the point that my code is not just a jumble of sections and classes
     with a bunch of lists together. I didn’t even know that there was a button element until I
read this article which shows how much coding I’ve done. </p>
<p>A big point that the article did have was that since there are so many elements, would anyone really take the time to learn them?
   I’d have to say that, unless your profession was to create the most efficient websites, then probably not.
   It takes a lot of time and experience in order to code correctly and effectively, but when done correctly the site can process faster,
    better, and it’ll be readable for whoever looks at your code. It is better overall.</p>
	<p>So I guess the main point of the article is to code with purpose because right now, most people are coding with what they have known
     instead of what is currently available. The call to action to code with thought and not to slack on learning with CSS and HTML.</p>
	<p>I am still new at all of this, but I will make sure that I actually learn the tags and figure out how to use them correctly
     so I will not only overwhelm myself on trying to fix it, but also won’t overwhelm my site with meaningless code.</p>
