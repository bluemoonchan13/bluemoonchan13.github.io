      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Gina Ng and I plan on having several pets.
         I want a dog, cat, snake, bunny, guinea pig, mini pig, and maybe a sea otter (it depends on if I can get a nice pool or not).
          I love animals and nice walks in my backyard.
         I game occasionally and have spurts of when I decide to read. </p>
       <p>My thought process is odd and very jumpy but when I come up with an idea that I like I stick to it and try to bring it to reality.
          But I think my biggest flaw in my thought processes is that I need to have all of the information whether it seems
           irrelevant or not in order to begin to brainstorm ideas for a project.
          Because once I’m generally set on an idea, it’s very hard for me to change my way of thinking for that project.</p>
       <p>But my general day to day thought process would go like: coding, language, I should probably learn chinese,
          I don’t visit my grandpa often, I need to change the oil in my car, I have to drive to sf next week,
           I need to go grocery shopping, I should go to Michael’s later, maybe my friend wants to come, did he clean his room yet?,
            I should have noodles for dinner. It makes sense in my head but when I type it out,
             it doesn’t seem to have a logical path but it does. Just trust me on it.</p>
