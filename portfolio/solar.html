      <h3>Solar Home</h3>
      <p>This house was created to be a zero net energy house which would become student housing.
         The house would house four people while still interacting with the people who inhabit it.
        So I created a nana wall which would allow an entire wall to open up connect the outdoor patio with the indoor living.
         I also included a nook seating area in the living room where the window is so that it would create an atmosphere of
       being both inside and outside while sitting in the space. Another part of the house similar to this is the kitchen bar.
         The bar is connecting the outside patio with the kitchen which creates a more interactive area where parties or get
          togethers would happen.</p>
       <p>This house was made for extrovertive people who thrive off of being social which is why the common areas are the
          largest part of the house. While the more private space is farther into the house and tucked away with a separate
           entrance for those days that aren’t your best.</p>
       <p>This house was made to be experienced instead of just seen so I created it in an interactive model so it
          would be seen at anyone’s pace and at their own freedom.</p>
