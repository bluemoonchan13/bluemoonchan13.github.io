    <h1>What is Virtual Reality</h1>
    <p>Reality is based on our senses: sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound.
       So if we change any one of these, then could we question our current reality?
        Virtual reality (VR) is a three dimensional environment that is created through technology.
         Virtual reality is not limited to anything.
          It is expanded to however creative a person is and it can be applied to everything.
           Some of the applications would be architecture, sports, medicine, arts, entertainment, aviation,
            and many more than what I have listed.
             In almost a hundred years of development in technology we have moved from hard clunking machines
              to things that make us question if what we are seeing is real.
      And the crazy thing is, there is so much more that is not explored that I could not imagine possible yet.</p>
