    <h1>Developing Imagination</h1>
    <p>Virtual reality is amazing, frightening, complex, and grand. In almost fifty years,
       virtual reality has developed to the point where anyone can obtain it and delve
        into complete immersion of a virtual world.
         But the future is unimaginable right now.</p>
    <p>There are currently so many advances in technology in general that in a year,
       the world could change dramatically.
        Every day there are technical advances that may not be on market but is
         changing the way the world thinks.</p>
    <p>I imagine a changed world.
       The world could become doomsday where everyone is taken over by computers
        or we can finally have hover cars or teleportation, but in the future,
       virtual reality will be a normal state of the world.
      VR will probably be used so computers and monitors will not need to be created,
       which in turn will save material waste.
      We would be able to take photos and produce them in three dimension so photos
       would no longer be in 2D. We would have schools using virtual monitors instead
     of textbooks. We could have business meetings with virtual meetings so there would
      be no need for excess travel. There will be constant updates but everything will
     be progressing to that point where I will not be able to imagine or thought possible. </p>
