     <p>First simulator was created and it was for flight simulation.
        It was created by Edwin Link and it was for training pilots.
       Although his simulator was not actually virtual, it created
        the environment for people to understand how it will be to fly
        and the idea that these types of activities can be practiced
       before doing risky operations created the basis of what virtual reality could become.</p>

       <h1><a name="1957">1957</a></h1>
       <p>Morton Heilig created the first multimedia device for interactive theatre.
          He is considered the father of VR. The multimedia device was called Sensorama.
          This was an intricate design that included a screen inside a booth which showed
         stereoscopic images, oscillating fans, speakers, and a device that would emit smells
       to help create that completely enveloped environment. The booth would be placed with a
        rotating chair to allow the user’s entire body to be immersed into the experience.</p>
        <p>Not too long after Heilig created his booth, Philco Corporation created the first
           head mounted display (HMD) to help helicopter pilots to see their surroundings at night.</p>

       <p>Ivan Sutherland created the Ultimate Display which was another HMD but it was attached to a computer.
          Since computers were still very large, the headset had to be suspended in order for the user to wear
           the device and move the user’s head. The Ultimate Display was able to track head movement to
            correspond to the user’s viewpoint. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) went in a
             different way with interface.</p>

       <h1><a name="1970">1970</a></h1>
       <p>MIT created the first interactive map of Aspen on the computer where you could zoom in and out of aerial photos.
          It was to allow people to walk through the town of Aspen through the screen.</p>

       <p>Michael McGreevy was able to create a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for NASA.
          This virtual reality was meant to help simulate space for training astronauts.</p>

       <p>Virtual reality became popular by Jaron Lanier and Tom Zimmerman.
          They both created the VRL which was one of the first companies to sell virtual reality.
         The virtual reality craze spiked in popularity quickly but then just as quickly dissipated
          because of Lanier’s essays of the human masses not being a credible source.
          But that’s for another site. </p>
        <p>Even though vr seemed to lose it’s original coolness, the movie industry took it with open arms.
           Lawnmower Man was created in 1992 and it focused on VR, but it wasn’t until the Matrix series
            came out that virtual reality took off in 1999.
           Even though they were not all positive ideas, there was a lot of controversial talk about virtual reality. </p>
        <p>Continuing on with the entertainment themes, Sega and Nintendo got into a race for vr.
           1990, the two gaming companies tried creating gaming headsets that would launch gaming into the future.
            Sega couldn’t get past the prototype while Nintendo didn’t get to bring it out full force because of
            the graphics at the time.</p>
